Development and contributing
============================

Testing
=======

The testing framework is `py.test <http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_. The
tests (in ``test/``) can be run with ``make test`` in the top directory.

Contributing
============

Some basic rules:

* Write unit tests.
* Write docstrings.

To get started, fork the repository. Work on it and let me know when it does
something you like!
